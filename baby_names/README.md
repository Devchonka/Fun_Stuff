The idea is to pull an html file which will look like the below in the relevant fields.. 

Here's what the html looks like in the baby.html files:
...
<h3 align="center">Popularity in 1990</h3>
....
<tr align="right"><td>1</td><td>Michael</td><td>Jessica</td>
<tr align="right"><td>2</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Ashley</td>
<tr align="right"><td>3</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Brittany</td>
...

And to learn regular expressions using python. The script will either write a dictionary of girl and boy names with their ranking to a file, or print them out nicely. The usage is as follows: 

[--summaryfile] baby_file_name.html [summary_file_name.txt]

Parameters in brackets are optional.
